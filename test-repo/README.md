# Example Project

Welcome to the Example Project! This project serves as a simple demonstration of Python programming concepts, including classes and modules. It provides basic arithmetic operations and a friendly greeting feature.

## Features

- **Calculator**: A class that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Greeter**: A class that greets the user with a friendly message.
- **Utility Functions**: A set of utility functions to support the main application logic.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: The main entry point for the example app. It contains the `Calculator` and `Greeter` classes.
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions used throughout the project.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/example-project.git
   cd example-project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can run the main application to see it in action.

### Example Usage

To perform arithmetic operations using the `Calculator` class, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The result will be displayed in the console.

To receive a friendly greeting from the `Greeter` class, you can also run the main application and follow the prompts.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A machine learning library for Python.
- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/): An open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library.

## TODO

- [ ] Add more advanced arithmetic operations to the `Calculator` class.
- [ ] Enhance the greeting messages in the `Greeter` class.
- [ ] Provide more detailed usage examples and documentation.
